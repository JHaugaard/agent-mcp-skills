I’m starting this brainstorming session to develop ideas for the follwing goal: Build a Claude Code Skill that will guide me, in a collaborative way, to building MCP servers that can be incorporated into apps.

The ultimate goal is to incorporate this mcp-building skill into our existing workflow that can be found at: @/Users/john/.claude/skills/workflow

In fact you, the brainstorming skill are a part of, in fact the lead off skill, of this workflow.

I am locating this brainstorming session in another project folder: @/Volumes/dev/develop/capability-ecosystem

I’ve done because Claude Code and I have nearly finished building an MCP server, and I anticipate buidling a number of new ones. That project has taken place in the parent folder of this brainstorming folder.

I am taking this approach as a result of several circumstances: (1) I am new to this process and I have no particular embedded skillset or vested experiential baggage related to apps developed with procedural coding methods; (2) I foresee the future to include a growth in the use of AI Agents, using MCP Servers and Tool, that are wrapped one, two, or many thin skins to surface themselves to users; and (3) I believe that the use of one-off, bespoke MCP servers - one or perhaps several per app - will leverage the use of LLM and Ai to make apps that even I can conceive and build much more powerful.

I will end this introductory document here, and enter a brainstorming session with you. Okay?
